# Background

So far, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are usually used for image processing. In this study, we aim to analyze if CNN can also be used for processing text.

# Research Question

Convolution Neural Networks are usually used for image processing. So, for this study, we want to investigate whether CNN can be effectively applied to text processing.

# Data

- The data is provided in the form of text files and does not contain any tabular format data.
- The dataset consists of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents from 20 different newsgroups, with a total size of approximately 46 MB.
- Source: [Dataset Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/113/twenty+newsgroups)
- Data Size: 46MB
- Data Shape (Number of Rows and Columns): It does not follow a traditional tabular structure; instead, data is present in the form of text files (.txt format).
- The data represents different news articles.
- Text documents serve as the input variables, and the target variables are the class labels (Name of the class group).
